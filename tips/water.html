		<h1>How to Boil Water</h1>

		<p>It's important to know how to boil water for many things in the kitchen. You'll need to boil water to make pasta, to boil an egg, and to make tea. This tip will make your life much easier in the kitchen.</p>


		<h2>Method</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Boiling means bringing water to 212 degrees Fahrenheit for cooking. But you don't need a thermometer to boil water. The process to boil water (or any other kind of liquid) is simple, and you need to follow only a few steps.</li>
			<li>Put some water in a pan or pot. Don't fill it to the top, or the water will splash out of the pan when it boils!</li>
			<li>Place the pan on your stovetop and turn the burner to the highest setting.</li>
			<li>Let the water come to a full rolling boil (when the bubbles are rapidly breaking the surface). Covering the pot speeds the process by trapping surface heat.</li>
